As part of Enactus, you will work with a diverse group of students from which you will learn more than you could ever imagine. The field of social entrepreneurship is filled with some of the brightest minds in the world. The partnerships we make through our projects connect us to activist, business, and political leaders across the world. We are all united by common causes and work to eliminate inequities across the globe. </p>
          <p>As part of Enactus, you will be part of a family. This family extends far beyond Illinois Enactus. You're joining the largest business network in the world. This network consists of only the most driven students and business leaders. Surrounding yourself with these people is the best way to grow as an individual. On campus, you will be working with and learning from outstanding students and companies. You will have a new group of friends and countless social events to attend.

          <p>This organization would not exist without the projects. An Enactus project strives to improve the quality of life and standard of living for the people in need all over the world and in our local community. These projects are more than just community service - we are creating sustainable solutions and empowering individuals. The feeling of achievement you will experience after applying the knowledge you've gained in the classroom and equipping those in need with sustainable solutions you developed is almost impossible to describe. Yes, these projects also help you prepare for your future career, but they will make a much bigger impact than that. They will change the lives of others and shape your world view. By working on diverse teams and developing unique skills, you will gain experience from day one that you can talk about in interviews and for the rest of your life. In Enactus, every member is actively involved in a project, so you will be able to speak on and remember the specific impact you create in someone's life. </p>

                  <p>Grounds for Growth has taught entrepreneurial skills to over 150 residents at Restoration Urban Ministries, a transitional housing program in Champaign. These skills include resume building, goal setting, business communication, and budgeting. Through our soap and scrub production, we upcycled upwards of 50 pounds of coffee waste and hundreds of bars of used soap. This semester, we are working towards an enhanced marketing strategy to drive sales in hopes of overcoming the pandemic’s effect of lower consumer leisure spending. We are also revamping the curriculum to teach business acumen directed towards business operations, in preparation of delinking this project to RUM in the coming years. In addition, we hope to increase our partnerships in the Champaign-Urbana area with local businesses to localize our supply chain and ensure its sustainability.</p>

                  <p>Circle Cycle partners with local groups to hold six-week earn-a-bike programs where students in the Champaign-Urbana area learn to fix selected bikes and get to take them home at the end. The bicycles used in this program are abandoned bikes obtained from the University Police Department. Since many students abandon their bikes on campus over the summer or after graduation, the bikes have been problematic for the campus environment and a burden for their collection as well as storage. Thus, part of Circle Cycle’s mission is to upcycle those bikes to empower less privileged children with the mobility they deserve. Talk about two birds with one stone! This past semester, Circle Cycle held the first class of the pilot program with 8 students at the Don Moyer Boys and Girls Club. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, the program was halted and is expected to pick back up in Spring 2021. This semester, Circle Cycle will be focusing on 3 main areas: creating new contacts and partnerships within the CU bike and school community; planning a community-wide bike-a-thon event to raise funds in order to financially support project expenses; and improving upon project structure and curriculum based on observations from last semester. Work in these areas will make sure that we are ready to hit the ground running in the spring when we are able to continue our program!</p>

                  <p>At this point in time, CreAlgae has developed a base formula for our bioplastic, and we have numerous prototypes for our product, created using both wild and processed algae. Our future source of algae will primarily be local harmful algal blooms, and we’ve been in frequent contact with local lakes and state parks to confirm the existence of algae around us. CreAlgae is currently focusing on finalizing a formula for our product and conducting market research to identify various applications for our bioplastic. This semester, we will apply to different accelerators and competitions, such as iVenture and the Biodesign Challenge (which we will register for alongside Symmetry). Simultaneously, we will continue to build our advisor network on campus and off. This fall we will also create project branding through the completed design of a logo and published website. These plans will allow CreAlgae to become more established and expand our faculty and corporate resources. Our project is still in its formative stages, and this will be an amazing semester for its growth! </p>

                  <p>While Symmetry is one of the newest projects, it has been able to (1) create various colors of 'alternative woods' that resemble many of the exotic, tree-based woods driving deforestation, (2) receive positive, detailed feedback from potential early adopters, or wood hobbyists, in the Urbana-Champaign area, and (3) significantly speed up its manufacturing process. Before it was part of the Enactus portfolio, the concept behind Symmetry was also named as a finalist idea for the Technology Entrepreneur Center's (TEC) 2020 Illinois Innovation Prize. Now, along with CreAlgae, it is looking to represent U of I in the school's first-ever entry in The Biodesign Challenge (BDC), an annual competition in which teams of artists and scientists from universities across the world develop sustainable products with biotechnology. To prepare for this during the next semester, Symmetry is looking to sell small quantities of its material to early adopters, begin research into biotech that can further accelerate its manufacturing, secure partnerships with vendors on campus that can provide the food waste used to grow the alternative wood, and start organizing a coalition of companies and other groups addressing deforestation. </p>

                  <p>Sage has formed community partners with assisted living facilities in which volunteers interact with the residents and interview them on a range of topics. In the first year, we had collected over 20 stories and met with 5 seniors regularly. With these interactions, the residents reported feeling more connected with the youth culture and youth participants reported an increased sense of appreciation for their elders. Going forward, Sage is working to curate custom books that comprise the stories collected from the seniors. With the increased vulnerability of older adults due to COVID-19, Sage is working to integrate the interactions onto a virtual atmosphere.</p>

                  <p>Hydrologic has established partnerships with key campus stakeholders like University Housing and Campus Recreation in order to conduct tests, and potentially implement low-flow showerheads in dorms and gyms across campus. Through outreach, we have also solidified on a needs analysis and intend to use our findings to further the project next semester. We plan to inform our decision to pursue a novel concept vs an existing solution by forming technical partners and collecting data through market research.  Furthermore, the team will strive to apply for grants to ease the financial burden of testing showerhead solutions to determine the most appropriate fit for the university. By the end of the semester, Hydrologic aims to decide the avenue for low-flow technology, finalize a university-targeted proposal, and gain technical partnerships. </p>
